Feature: Share by public link
  As a user
  I want to share files through a publicly accessible link
  So that users who do not have an account on my ownCloud server can access them

  As an admin
  I want to limit the ability of a user to share files/folders through a publicly accessible link
  So that public sharing is limited according to organization policy

  Background:
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes

  @smokeTest @issue-ocis-reva-383
  Scenario Outline: simple sharing by public link
    Given user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user creates a new public link for resource "<shared-resource>" using the webUI
    Then user "user1" should have a share with these details:
      | field       | value              |
      | share_type  | public_link        |
      | uid_owner   | user1              |
      | permissions | read               |
      | path        | /<shared-resource> |
      | name        | Public link        |
    And a link named "Public link" should be listed with role "Viewer" in the public link list of resource "<shared-resource>" on the webUI
    When the public uses the webUI to access the last public link created by user "user1"
    Then file "lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | shared-resource |
      | simple-folder   |
      | lorem.txt       |

    And as "user1" file "/simple-folder/lorem.txt" should not exist
    And as "user1" file "/simple-folder/data.zip" should not exist


  Scenario: files are not selected initially in the public share
    Given user "user1" has created a public link with following settings
      | path | /simple-folder |
      | name | public link    |
    When the public uses the webUI to access the last public link created by user "user1"
    Then these files should not be selected on the webUI
      | name                |
      | lorem.txt           |
      | simple-empty-folder |
      | data.zip            |


  Scenario: public selects files and clear the selection in the public share
    Given user "user1" has created a public link with following settings
      | path | /simple-folder |
      | name | public link    |
    When the public uses the webUI to access the last public link created by user "user1"
    And the public marks these files for batch action using the webUI
      | name                |
      | lorem.txt           |
      | simple-empty-folder |
      | data.zip            |
    Then these files should be selected on the webUI
      | name                |
      | lorem.txt           |
      | simple-empty-folder |
      | data.zip            |
    When the public clears the selection of files
    Then these files should not be selected on the webUI
      | name                |
      | lorem.txt           |
      | simple-empty-folder |
      | data.zip            |

  Scenario: public accesses public share that is password protected
    Given user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user creates a new public link for resource "lorem.txt" using the webUI
    And the user edits the public link named "Public link" of file "lorem.txt" changing following
      | password | pass123 |
    And the public tries to open the public link page of the last public link created by user "user1" with password "pass123"
    Then file "lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
